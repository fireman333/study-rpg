## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Homepage SHALL surface a one-tap-dismissable first-visit onboarding that never reappears once dismissed

The homepage SHALL render a brief, skippable onboarding panel gated on a persisted `meta['homepageOnboardingDismissed']` flag. Dismissing it SHALL set the flag so it never reappears, including after F5 reload. The account-reset path SHALL clear the flag so a reset user sees the onboarding again. The existing `/connectome` first-visit callout SHALL be left in place (it serves users who land directly on `/connectome`). The onboarding panel SHALL NOT host any 首抽 (first-pull) CTA — the explicit first-pull ritual is retired; first-pull is now granted automatically on each family's first answer (per `neuron-path-representative`), so no onboarding CTA or compact 首抽 entry is shown anywhere.

#### Scenario: First-time user sees onboarding
- **WHEN** the homepage loads and `meta['homepageOnboardingDismissed']` is absent or false
- **THEN** the onboarding panel renders above the fold with a one-tap dismiss control

#### Scenario: Dismissed onboarding does not reappear
- **WHEN** the user dismisses the onboarding and later reloads the homepage (including F5)
- **THEN** the onboarding does not render and `meta['homepageOnboardingDismissed']` is true

#### Scenario: Account reset re-surfaces onboarding
- **WHEN** the user resets account data
- **THEN** `meta['homepageOnboardingDismissed']` is cleared and the onboarding renders again on next homepage load

#### Scenario: Connectome callout is unchanged
- **WHEN** a first-time user navigates directly to `/connectome` with no synapses
- **THEN** the existing `/connectome` empty-state callout still renders (it is not removed by this change)

#### Scenario: No first-pull CTA in onboarding
- **WHEN** the onboarding renders for a new player
- **THEN** no 首抽 / first-pull CTA is present in the onboarding panel or the CTA toolbar
